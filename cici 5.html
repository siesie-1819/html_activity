    <h1>The Tortoise and the Hare</h1>
    <h2>Aesop</h2>

    <p>
        A <font color="violet" size="14px"><b>Hare</b></font> was making fun of the
        <font color="violet" size="14px"><b>Tortoise</b></font> one day for being so slow.
        "Do you ever get anywhere?" he asked with a mocking laugh.
        "Yes," replied the <font color="violet" size="14px"><b>Tortoise</b></font>,
        "and I get there sooner than you think. I'll run you a race and prove it."
   
        The <font color="violet" size="14px"><b>Hare</b></font> was much amused at the idea of running a race with the
        <font color="violet" size="14px"><b>Tortoise</b></font>, but for the fun of the thing he agreed.
        So the <font color="violet" size="14px"><b>Fox</b></font>, who had consented to act as judge,
        marked the distance and started the runners off.The <font color="violet" size="14px"><b>Hare</b></font>
        was soon far out of sight, and to make the <font color="violet" size="14px"><b>Tortoise</b></font> feel very deeply how ridiculous it was for him
        to try a race with a <font color="violet" size="14px"><b>Hare</b></font>,
        he lay down beside the <font color="green" size="14px"><u>course</u></font> to take a nap until the
        <font color="violet" size="14px"><b>Tortoise</b></font> should catch up.The <font color="violet" size="14px"><b>Tortoise</b></font>
        meanwhile kept going slowly but steadily, and,
        after a time, passed the place where the <font color="violet" size="14px"><b>Hare</b></font> was sleeping.
        But the <font color="violet" size="14px"><b>Hare</b></font> slept on very peacefully; and when at last he did wake up,
        the <font color="violet" size="14px"><b>Tortoise</b></font> was near the goal.
        <font color="red" size="14px"><sup>The Hare now ran his swiftest, but he could not overtake the Tortoise in time.</sup></font>
        <font color="blue" size="14px"><sub>The Tortoise wins the race through steady effort.</sub></font>
    </p>

    <p>
        <font color="yellow" size="14px"><em>The race is not always to the swift.</em></font>
