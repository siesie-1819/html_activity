      <h2>My First Encounter with SB19</h2>
      <span>March 2021</span>

      <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/1200x/40/5f/d8/405fd8e6e48903f94feb4f6aac00961a.jpg" alt="SB19 MAPA era">

      <p>
        The first time I encountered <span class="highlight">SB19</span> was during the release of their song
        <span class="highlight">“MAPA”</span>. At that time, I wasn’t really a fan yet. I heard the song,
        appreciated the emotions, but I didn’t fully understand the group behind it.
      </p>

      <p>
        MAPA felt sincere and touching, but I was just a listener back then. I didn’t follow their updates,
        watch interviews, or search for their content. It was simply a moment of awareness, not yet connection.

      <h2>How I Became a Fan</h2>
      <span>November 2023</span>

      <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/1715339435276181504/pu/img/tHUvywCaqqrKa3ST.jpg" alt="SB19 ShowBreak">

      <p>
        Everything changed when I randomly saw a clip from <span class="highlight">ShowBreak Episode 5</span>
        the Whisper Challenge on TikTok. It was funny, natural, and very different from what I expected
        from a music group.
      </p>

      <p>
        I laughed so hard that I ended up searching “SB19 funny moments” out of curiosity. One video led to
        another, and before I realized it, I was already watching interviews, performances, and behind-the-scenes
        clips. That was the moment I knew I had become a fan.

      <h2>From Stell to Pablo: Finding My Bias</h2>
      <span>Present</span>

      <img src="https://i.pinimg.com/736x/9d/9d/18/9d9d186d9efd12a83349c5356d9b0702.jpg" alt="SB19 Pablo">

      <p>
        At first, my bias was <span class="highlight">Stell</span>. His humor, confidence, and strong stage presence
        really stood out to me. He was entertaining and easy to like, especially in variety shows and challenges.
      </p>

      <p>
        However, as I learned more about the group, my bias slowly shifted to <span class="highlight">Pablo</span>.
        His songwriting, leadership, and depth as an artist impressed me deeply. I admired how he expresses emotions
        through music and how he leads the group with sincerity and purpose.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the end, SB19 is a group where every member shines in their own way. My journey as a fan continues,
        and this blog is where I choose to share that experience.
