        Hi! My name is <span class="highlight">Cassie</span>, and I am a proud fan of
        <span class="highlight">SB19</span>. I created this blog to share my personal journey,
        thoughts, and experiences as someone who slowly discovered and fell in love with their music.
      </p>

      <p>
        I enjoy listening to music, watching performances, and discovering the stories behind every
        song. SB19 inspired me not only through their talent but also through their perseverance,
        authenticity, and passion for their craft.
      </p>

      <p>
        This blog serves as a space where I can express myself, document my fandom journey, and
        connect with other people who appreciate music, creativity, and meaningful stories.
        Being an <span class="highlight">A’TIN</span> is something I am truly proud of.
